<p><em>Blogs that have a specific angle to talking about food are inspiring. Check out my personal inspiration, <a href="https://smittenkitchen.com/">Smitten Kitchen</a>! The author writes about cooking within the confines of a tiny New York kitchen. Her photos are beautiful, and her stories are funny. She also has smart navigation--you can browse by season, by archive, or click "surprise me" and see what recipe is generated.</em></p>
